    <p><br>Pasta is a delicious, go-to meal you can throw together in minutes. But cooking it with the "just right" al dente texture—chewy, firm, and fork-tender—takes technique. Follow these simple steps and you'll be nailing it like nonna in no time.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>large pot</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>tongs</li>
        <li>colander</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil water in a large pot.</strong> To prevent pasta from sticking together, use at least 4 quarts of water for every pound of noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt the water with at least 1 tablespoon, and more is fine.</strong> The salty water adds flavor to the pasta.</li>
        <li><Strong>Add pasta</Strong> Pour pasta into boiling water. There's no need to break the pasta; it will soften up within 30 seconds and fit into the pot.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir occasionally</strong> As the pasta starts to cook, stir it well with the tongs so the noodles don't stick to each other (or the pot).</li>
        <li><strong>Test the pasta by tasting it.</strong> Follow the cooking time on the package, but always taste pasta before draining to make sure the texture is right. Pasta cooked properly should be al dente—a little chewy.</li>
        <li><Strong>Drain</Strong> Drain cooked pasta well in a colander. If serving it hot, add sauce right away; if you're making a pasta salad, run noodles under cold water to stop the cooking.</li>
    </ol>
