    <p>WHY I LOVE PAN SEARED CHICKEN BREASTS</p>
    <p>This has become my go-to method for cooking chicken breasts. Not only is it super fast and easy, but you get a lot of delicious browning on the outside of the meat, which is something that doesn’t happen in the gentle heat of an oven. Plus, you can change the seasoning and make it taste like something new every time!</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp steak seasoning ($0.20)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.05)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sweet paprika ($0.05)</li>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1.3 lbs. total) ($6.79)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.08)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp butter (optional) ($0.10)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the steak seasoning, smoked paprika, and sweet paprika in a bowl. Coat the chicken breasts liberally with the seasoning on all sides.</li>
        <li>Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-low (or medium for thin-cut breasts). Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for about 8 minutes without flipping (5 minutes for thin-cut breasts). Flip the chicken and then cook on the second side until well browned and cooked through (internal temperature of 165ºF).</li>
        <li>For extra luscious chicken, add a tablespoon of butter to the skillet, allow it to melt, then flip the chicken a couple of times to coat in the melted butter.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board and allow it to rest for five minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        
    </ol>
